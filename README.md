# Machine_learning
in this repo, all projects were built by several machine learning models including unsupervised and supervised learning. 
firstly, preprocessing stage has been done primarily using fundamental statistics such as uni and multi-variate analysis, ANOVA, chi-square test
Other technics such as feature engine also was used in this step: ...label encode, one-hot...scaling....
Furthermore, model selection and model tuning was also done based on different metric results.. however, as constrained resources, not all good models can be used in computing.
